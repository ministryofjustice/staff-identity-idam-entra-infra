# Managing Application Registrations

## Overview

You can manage your Application Registration setup from the file [../../terraform/data.application-registrations.tf](../../terraform/data.application-registrations.tf).

To create a new one you can add a new unique key under `app_registration_list` and supply the appropriate properties and values to configure your application.

Once complete you can raise a Pull Request which the IDAM team will review and process further.

## Example Usage

Below are a few examples of how this can be setup.

### Single Sign On Application Setup

To create a Application Registration that will allow your application to use Entra ID as its Authentication provider, you can use the following code.

```
eucs_idam_tf_test_app_reg = {
    department_name              = "eucs"
    team_name                    = "idam"
    application_name             = "app-reg"
    notes                        = "Test IDAM Team SSO Application for integration from test application."
    service_management_reference = "SCTASK0000123"
    owners_devl                  = ["xxx.xxx@devl.justice.gov.uk", "xxx.xxx@devl.justice.gov.uk"]
    owners_nle                   = ["xxx.xxx@test.justice.gov.uk", "xxx.xxx@test.justice.gov.uk"]
    owners_live                  = ["xxx.xxx@justice.gov.uk", "xxx.xxx@justice.gov.uk"]
    homepage_url                 = "https://example.com"
    logout_url                   = "https://example.com/logout"
    redirect_uris                = ["https://example.com/account"]
    tenants_required             = ["DEVL", "NLE", "LIVE"]

    required_resource_access_scopes = ["User.Read"]
    required_resource_access_roles  = []

    allowed_groups = ["MoJO - Users - All"]

    create_access_package = false
    app_roles                    = []
}
```

### Single Sign On Application with App Roles for Authorisation Setup

To create a Application Registration that will allow your application to use Entra ID as its Authentication provider and handle Authorisation via App Roles and Access Packages, you can use the following code.

For more information on App Roles, Access Packages and how to consume these in your application, read the following Microsoft Guidance.

    tenants_required             = ["DEVL", "NLE", "LIVE"]

    required_resource_access_scopes = ["User.Read"]
    required_resource_access_roles  = []

    allowed_groups = ["MoJO - Users - All"]

    create_access_package = false
    create_access_package = true
    app_roles = [
        {
            allowed_member_types = ["User"]
            description          = "ReadOnly roles have limited query access"
            display_name         = "ReadOnly"
            id                   = "${random_uuid.eucs_idam_tf_test_app_reg2_readonly.result}"
            value                = "User"
        },
        {
            allowed_member_types = ["User"]
            description          = "Administrator roles"
            display_name         = "Administrator"
            id                   = "${random_uuid.eucs_idam_tf_test_app_reg2_admin.result}"
            value                = "Admin"
        }
    ]
}
```
